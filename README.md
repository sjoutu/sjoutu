ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sjoutu. 

I'm currently a doctoral researcher at University of Turku with background in biomedicine and biotechnology. In my research, I focus on exploring the vast possibilities of using next (and third) generation sequencing technologies to enhance antibody screening in terms of throughput, accuracy, and efficiency. Equipped with a strong DIY attitude, I love delving deep into methods I use in my projects, even if it means learning a totally new programming language from scratch. Python, UNIX, 3D printing and microcontrollers have become essential tools in my arsenal, providing solutions to nearly any challenge encountered.

Disclousure: I'm not a programmer, so pardon me if my code is not always the most optimized - if it does the intended job, I'm happy. Of course, I'm open to learn more, so commenting is most welcome! :blush:

I'm looking to share the analysis scripts used in my research and publications here for better accessibility, hopefully providing some help for someone analyzing similar data.
